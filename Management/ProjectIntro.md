# COMP 4203 – Project Introduction

## Registering your group
- Why?
  - project deliverables are set up in Brightspace as group assignments
  - easier for you!
  - easier for me!
- How?
  - submit the group member names in Brightspace
    - use the Group registration “assignment”
    - even if you’re working alone
- Deadline
  - official due date: Friday, February 13
  - but the link is available until end of day Monday, February 16

## What qualifies as a project?
- You need the following:
  - find a research problem to explore
    - it must be based on wireless networking or wireless security concepts
    - if you choose a security topic, it must applicable to wireless only! not wired networks
    - it must be based on recent peer-reviewed academic research
  - use at least two papers published in an academic journal or conference
  - papers must be less than seven years old
  - implement a small software system that demonstrates the problem
    - it must simulate a wireless network
    - it must simulate a particular behaviour in the network, based on the problem
    - it must show network and its behaviour visually
    - beware network simulation tools! they won’t let you change the protocols
  - most projects will not be able to use these tools

## What qualifies as a project? (cont.)
- You need the following:
  - collect the results demonstrated by the simulation code
    - you must have some metrics defined that your simulation will collect
  - evaluate and analyze your results
    - you must compare your metrics against existing work
    - probably the academic papers that you selected
- Beware the temptation to work alone!
  - last time, 100% of students who worked alone dropped the course
  - almost no students in groups dropped
  - creative work requires brainstorming and people to “bounce ideas off of”
  - almost no academic papers are sole-authored

## Project deliverables
- Proposal
  - a written report that describes:
    - the background research, as found in the academic papers selected
    - the problem to be explored for the project
    - how the problem will be simulated in software
    - what results will be collected
    - how the results will be evaluated and compared
  - a 8–10 minute in-class presentation that describes all of the above
    - must be at least 8 minutes!
    - you must practice to make sure you meet this minimum
  - changes to the nature or scope of the project after the proposal submission must be approved again by instructor

## Project deliverables (cont.)
- Final report must describe:
  - the background research, as found in the academic papers selected
  - the problem that was explored for the project
  - how the problem was simulated in software
    - algorithms, methodologies, high-level design
  - collected results
    - actual data
  - evaluation and analysis of results
    - comparison with previous results, performance, efficiency
- not computational performance or efficiency!
  - usually shown with graphics (graphs, histograms, bar charts, pie charts)
- Simulation code and working demo

## Selecting a topic
- Projects are:
  - group-based (2 or 3 students)
  - every group selects their unique project topic (problem to explore)
- Topics can be:
  - based on a new idea, or
  - an extension of ideas found in research, or
  - a combination of two or more existing ideas

## Selecting a topic (cont.)
- Possible areas for topics:
  - neighbour discovery protocols
  - wireless network management
  - routing in mobile and wireless networks
  - ad hoc networking, mesh networking, sensor networks
  - mobility support in IPv4 or IPv6
  - wireless security – CANNOT apply to wired network security
  - wireless traffic analysis, packet sniffer
  - satellite communications
  - localization in wireless networks

## Searching for papers
- Google Scholar is an excellent resource
  - it lists tons of academic papers
  - it includes dependencies between papers
  - it provides correct citation formatting
- But it has drawbacks
  - not all papers have been peer-reviewed and published academically
    - you need to double-check in an official database of academic papers
  - the papers are not always free of charge
- Solution to the both drawbacks
  - Carleton Library

## Searching for papers (cont.)
- Academic papers can be found online from Carleton Library
  - search databases => by subject => Computer Science
  - good databases:
    - IEEE Xplore
    - ACM Digital Library
    - Scholars Portal
    - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
  - all papers are free!
- If you find a paper that you like, but it’s too old:
  - go to Google Scholar and find the old paper
  - click on “Cited by” link
  - you’ll find newer papers related to that topic
